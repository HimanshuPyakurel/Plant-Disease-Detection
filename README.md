# Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
<p align="lect">Plant diseases detection is the process of detecting diseases from the plant. The infections or its indications, for example, coloured spots or lines, are usually visible on the plant's leaves or stem. Based on that, the diseases are determined. In this project, i am using Convoluitona neural Netowork for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. For Training, i used Plant village dataset. Dataset Link is given below.

## Algorithm
### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
<p align="lect">CNN is used in image processing because they can effectively extract features from images and learn to recognize patterns, making them 
well-suited for tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and classification. They have shown impressive results in various real-world applications and have revolutionized the field of computer vision.</p>
